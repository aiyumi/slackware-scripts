To use these SlackBuilds with Sbopkg, download and rename this "slackbuilds"
directory to "aiyumisb" and place it into "/var/lib/sbopkg". Copy the
file "100-aiyumi.repo" to your "/etc/sbopkg/repos.d", then edit
"/etc/sbopkg/sbopkg.conf" to set it as your default repository, like this:

REPO_BRANCH=${REPO_BRANCH:-local}
REPO_NAME=${REPO_NAME:-aiyumisb}

Or, if you don't want to make it your default, you can start Sbopkg with this
command:

# sbopkg -V aiyumisb/local
