After installing the package, edit "/etc/espeakup.conf" to set the Espeak voice
you want Espeakup to use by default, the pitch, the speech rate and volume.

Then, to start Espeakup, run the "/etc/rc.d/rc.espeakup" script. To start
Espeakup on system initialization, call
the script from your "/etc/rc.d/rc.local".
