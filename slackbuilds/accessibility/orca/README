This is the Orca screen reader. It requires gnome-python, atspi2-core,
atspi2-atk, pyatspi.

After building and installing the package, copy either
"/usr/doc/orca-x.x-xdesktop/orca.atspi2.xinitrc"
or
"/usr/doc/orca-x.x-xdesktop/orca.atspi2.xinitrc"
to your $HOME and rename it as ".xinitrc". "orca.atspi2.xinitrc" only works
with AT-SPI2, while "orca.atspi12.xinitrc" works with both, but AT-SPI1 is
deprecated, so it's recommended that you use AT-SPI2 (the old .xinitrc is only
here just in case...).

After that, open the ".xinitrc" in a text editor and uncomment or edit the 
last line, setting it to start your desktop environment. For example, 
uncomment (remove the "#") from the line with

#exec /usr/bin/startfluxbox

to use Fluxbox, or change it to (for example)

exec /usr/bin/startxfce4

if you want to use XFCE.
