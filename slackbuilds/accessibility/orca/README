This is the Orca screen reader. It requires speech-dispatcher, python3,
py3cairo, pygobject3-python3, pyxdg and pyatspi, as well as the atspi2-atk and
atspi2-core packages that come with Slackware.

After building and installing the package, copy the file
"/usr/doc/orca-*/orca.atspi2.xinitrc"
to your $HOME and rename it to ".xinitrc."

After that, open the ".xinitrc" in a text editor and uncomment or edit the 
last line, and set it to start your desktop environment. For example, 
uncomment (remove the "#") from the line with

#exec /usr/bin/startfluxbox

to use Fluxbox, or change it to (for example)

exec /usr/bin/startxfce4

if you want to use XFCE.
