This is a modified version of the slackbuilds.org script.
If you are on Slack64, you need the multilib packages installed. See:

http://alien.slackbook.org/dokuwiki/doku.php?id=slackware:multilib

You also need JACK compiled for 32-bit (compile it as per the instructions from the multilib 
page and use "convertpkg-compat32" on the package before installing).


The dssi-vst package contains a wrapper plugin for Windows VSTs that
enables them to be used by DSSI hosts running on Linux or similar on i386
using Wine.

VST's dll must installed in /usr/lib/vst. You can override this with
variable VST_PATH in your ~/.profile
