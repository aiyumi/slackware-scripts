This is a modified version of the slackbuilds.org script. It compiles both a
32-bit and a 64-bit version of the Wineasio library.
If you are on Slack64, you need the multilib packages installed. See:

http://alien.slackbook.org/dokuwiki/doku.php?id=slackware:multilib

You also need JACK compiled for 32-bit (compile it as per the instructions from the multilib 
page and use "convertpkg-compat32" on the package before installing).

WineASIO provides an ASIO to JACK driver for WINE. ASIO is the most common
Windows low-latency driver, so is commonly used in audio workstation
programs.

To build the package, you will need the file "asio.h" from the Steinberg
ASIO SDK, version 2.1 or greater. This file must be downloaded from
http://www.steinberg.net/en/company/developer.html and copied to the
directory containing the SlackBuild.

After installing the package, each user who will use wineasio must run
the command "regsvr32 wineasio.dll". This must be done as the user(s),
not as root. This only needs to be done once per user.

This can't be built on a stock Slackware64 system, since it requires
32-bit Wine. It may (or may not) be possible to build on a 64-bit multilib
system; let me know how it goes.
