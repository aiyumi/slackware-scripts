These are my custom Slackware tagfiles and mostly reflect my personal 
preferences.

This directory also contains a script called "tagfilediff.sh", used for
comparing tagfiles between Slackware versions.

An overview of what these tagfiles install or skip:

* a: install almost everything.

*ap: remove some email clients (Elm, Pine), the various text editors (Joe, Jove 
etc.). As I only use Vim, I add Vi/Vim and skip the rest.

* d: I remove things that I probably won't use and would only waste space, such
as GCC-Gfortran and other unusual compilers.

* e: I currently don't use Emacs.

* f: install everything.

* k: install everything.

* kde: I don't install KDE.

* kdei: skip, because no KDE.

* l: install everything. Its good to have all the libraries installed, because
Slackware have a good selection and many of these libs are required by 
a lot of external packages.

* n: remove Netatalk, the various FTP and chat clients, and also the servers, 
because I don't intend to run any server.

* t: install everything.

* tcl: install everything.

* x: install everything.

* xap: remove things I don't use, like the various window managers
(Blackbox, Fvwm, Windowmaker), Thunderbird, some media players, Rrdesktop,
Xchat...

* xfce: skip everything. I decided to use Fluxbox and not install Xfce.
